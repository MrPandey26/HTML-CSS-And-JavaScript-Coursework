                        The Internet is a network of networks. Fundamentally, it consists of a large number of Local Area Networks (LANs) that
                         have been connected to each other.LANs are the networks that organizations use to connect their computers. Computers 
                        that are connected by LANs are usually all located in the same building (hence the name), or in a few buildings which 
                        are located very close to each other.There is lots of competing and mutually incompatible LAN technologies; the most
                        popular are Novell NetWare and various Microsoft and IBM products. Nowadays everything seemsto be converging towards 
                          Internet technology. Technically,the LANs are incompatible because they used different communications protocols.
                         Most of them were designed for local area networks only, and hence they do not work very well for larger networks,
                        when the computers they connect are separated by large distances or where network bandwidth is scarce. <a href="https://www.websydian.com/olddoc/websydian_v60/knowledgebase/whitepapers/basicinternettechnology.htm" style="color: green;"><b>...Read more</b></a>

                          materials and video instructional exercises, the Internet has made the existences of understudies simpler. You can
